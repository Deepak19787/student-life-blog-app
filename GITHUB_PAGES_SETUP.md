# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Manual Steps Required**

Your project is ready, but GitHub Pages needs to be enabled manually. Follow these exact steps:

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Go to Repository Settings**
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: https://github.com/Deepak19787/student-life-blog-app
3. Click on the **Settings** tab (top navigation)

### **Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Scroll down to find **Pages** in the left sidebar
2. Click on **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, you have two options:

#### **Option A: Deploy from a branch (Recommended)**
- Select **Deploy from a branch**
- Choose **master** branch
- Select **/docs** folder
- Click **Save**

#### **Option B: GitHub Actions**
- Select **GitHub Actions**
- Click **Save**

### **Step 3: Wait for Deployment**

- GitHub will build and deploy your site

### **Step 4: Access Your Site**
Your site will be available at:

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If you still get 404:**
1. **Check the Actions tab**: https://github.com/Deepak19787/student-life-blog-app/actions
2. **Verify Pages is enabled**: Settings → Pages should show "Your site is live at..."
3. **Wait longer**: Sometimes it takes 10-15 minutes for the first deployment
